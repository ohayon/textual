            Before doing anything serious, it helps to have a loose plan.

            - Open the project
            - Skim recent changes
            - Make coffee :ablobcatcoffee:
            - Pretend this will be quick

            1. Identify the problem
            2. Try the obvious fix
               - Re-read the code
               - Add a `print` you’ll forget to remove
               - Question past decisions :ablobthinking:
            3. Realize it’s not that simple
            4. Fix the *actual* issue

            - Everything works on the first try
            - Something breaks, but in a new and exciting way
              - Tests fail
              - Confidence drops
              - Snacks are required
            - Miraculously, CI passes :100_valid:

            In all cases, remember to commit early and often.
